# Indoqa React/Redux archetype

This project is a ready-to-use setup for react/redux web applications we use at Indoqa. It is based on the 
react todos example and inspired by a lot of good ideas from the este dev stack. The main focus is to create a
consistant environment for client side web applications that are using business logic using REST services over HTTP. 

As we went all the way from server-side Java web applications like Wicket to this nice and clean redux architecture, we 
tried to develop a directory structure and build environment that looks familiar to Java developers.
